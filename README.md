A partition of n is a representation of this number as a sum of positive integers: n=n1+n2+...+nr such that n1≥n2≥...≥nr. The numbers n1,n2,...,nr are called parts.

The partition 19=5+3+3+2+2+2+2 can be written as 53224, while 19=5+2+2+2+2+2+2+2 can be written as 527.
Hence the upper indices are 124 and 107, thus 5+3+3+2+2+2+2 is larger than 5+2+2+2+2+2+2+2, 
since 124 is larger than 107.
